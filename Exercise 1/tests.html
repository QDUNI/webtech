        <h2>How to pass?</h2>
        <p class="tests__paragraph">
            You can only pass the course if you participate in the three partial
            exams (T1, T2, T3), and submit the three practical assignments on
            time (P1, P2, P3). Participation in lectures, seminars, or practical
            sessions is not compulsory, but staying away is
            not a good idea. All six components are assessed separately. At the
            end a total grade for the theory part is calculated: T = 0.2 * T1 +
            0.3 * T2 + 0.5 * T3. A total mark for the practical part is also
            calculated: P = 0.2 * P1 + 0.4 * P2 +
            0.4 * P3. If all parts are missing, your final mark is "ND" (not
            participated). You have not passed the course. If two partial exams
            or two practical assignments are missing, your final grade is "NVD"
            (not passed). You have not passed the
            course. If one partial exam and / or one practical grade is missing,
            your final grade is "AANV". You must then take an additional test
            and / or practical assignment to pass the course. If T &lt; 5.00 or
            P &lt; 5.00, the final grade E is the
            minimum of T and P. If T≥5.00 and P≥5.00, the final grade E is the
            average of T and P. The final grade is rounded to one decimal place,
            except between 5 and 6: the final grade is rounded to integers. So
            if E≥5.500 it becomes a 6, if E &lt;5.500
            it becomes a 5. If the final grade is at least 6, you have passed
            the course. If the final grade is lower than 4, you have not passed
            the course. If the final grade is 4,000 &lt; E &lt; 5,500, you can
            take an additional test and or practical
            assignment to try to pass the course. The additional test covers the
            entire material. The grade that you obtain for this test is entered
            for the missing grade, or for an insufficient partial grade of your
            choice. The mark for the additional
            practical assignment is entered for a missing or insufficient
            practical grade. The final grade is then recalculated according to
            the above rules. The additional test covers the entire material. The
            grade that you obtain for this test is entered
            for the missing grade, or for an insufficient partial grade of your
            choice. The mark for the additional practical assignment is entered
            for a missing or insufficient practical grade. The final grade is
            then recalculated according to the above
            rules. To participate in the additional test, the original result
            must be at least 4.
